# User-Directory
C# based directory of the Fellowship. Exploring passing data from one form to another and saving data.

THIS PROGRAM has 5 directly edited files:
- Form1.cs AND Form1.Designer.cs
    Not an inventive name, but this is the main viewing form, where existing .txt files can output a list of names and
    from which a user can usse buttons to close the program or access an add/edit feature

- fMember.cs
    This is the class file used to create and edit members in the UI

- addMem.cs AND addMem.Designer.cs
    Secondary form used for editing the directory members
    
    Use the .zip to run a Visual Studio program containing the file
